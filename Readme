Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This project implements a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances large language model responses using context retrieved from user-provided documents, URLs, and text inputs. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and suitable for real-world deployment.

Overview

The RAG system combines large language models (LLMs) with semantic search to produce grounded, context-aware answers. It ingests raw data, preprocesses it into structured knowledge, converts it into embeddings, retrieves the most relevant information, and finally generates responses using an LLM.

Key Features
Flexible Data Ingestion

Supports ingestion from URLs and uploaded text files.

Uses LangChain’s UnstructuredURLLoader for reliable extraction.

Automatically cleans and normalizes content for downstream processing.

Semantic Embedding Generation

Converts text into numerical vector embeddings using OpenAI embedding models.

Enables high-quality semantic understanding and similarity search.

Vector Store Retrieval

Uses FAISS as the vector store for efficient, low-latency similarity search.

Retrieves the most relevant text chunks for a given query.

Context-Aware Answer Generation

Retrieved information is passed into an LLM (ChatGPT).

Outputs are grounded, contextual, and significantly reduce hallucinations.

Modular Architecture

Components for ingestion, embeddings, vector storage, retrieval, and generation are fully decoupled.

Easy to upgrade, replace, or extend individual modules.

System Capabilities

End-to-end processing: ingestion → preprocessing → embedding → vector storage → retrieval → generation.

Scalable indexing pipeline capable of handling large volumes of unstructured data.

Support for custom datasets and arbitrary text sources.

High retrieval accuracy using FAISS similarity search.

Easy adaptation to enterprise knowledge bases, document QA, and domain-specific assistants.
